My domain doesn't have a HTTPS cert so rather than fork out and faff, I decided to forward my domain to GitHub Pages as I guess they're likely to be more reliable and they have HTTPS. I do enjoy writing stuff, even if its just for my own reference or catharsis, but I wasn't really happy with the built in Jekyll offering and other platforms either cost money or don't let you write in Markdown (easily).

I found [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and decided to give it a go. It's a neat framework that lets me write my posts in Markdown, test the look and feel of the site and proof read (lol) locally before generating the static site and deploying it to GitHub pages.

To deploy, it's just

```
hexo generate
hexo deploy
```
